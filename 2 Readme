2. Interesting data set recently discovered:

Recently, I came across the "NASA Exoplanet Archive" dataset, which provides comprehensive information about exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) discovered by NASA's Kepler and K2 missions. This dataset contains various attributes such as planet properties, orbital characteristics, stellar parameters, and detection methods.

Why it's my favorite:
I find this dataset intriguing because it offers a glimpse into the vastness and diversity of the universe. Exploring exoplanets allows us to study planetary systems beyond our own and gain insights into the possibility of habitable environments and the existence of extraterrestrial life. The NASA Exoplanet Archive dataset presents a rich collection of scientific data that can be used for research, analysis, and fostering our understanding of the cosmos.
